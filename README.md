## Projects

### 1) Project 1 - *Customer Sign-Up Behaviour & Data Quality Audit*
- **Goal:** Identify patterns and issues in customer sign-up behaviour to improve user acquisition quality and reduce data errors.
- **Data & Methods:** Loaded and cleaned customer sign-up and support ticket datasets using Python (pandas, NumPy), addressed missing and inconsistent values, normalised categorical features, converted data types, removed duplicates, and performed exploratory data analysis including segmentation by source, region, plan, and age group. Integrated support ticket data for behavioural insights.

### 2) Project 2 - *Sales and Customer Behaviour Insights*
- **Goal:** Analyse sales trends and customer purchasing behaviour to uncover opportunities for growth and targeted marketing.
- **Data & Methods:** Cleaned and standardised multiple datasets (sales, customer, product), applied fuzzy matching to fix categorical inconsistencies, engineered features such as revenue, price bands, and days-to-order, performed statistical analysis including Pearson correlation, applied MinMax scaling, and used Python (pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib) to visualise trends and segment customers.

### 3) Project 3 - *Churn Prediction for StreamWorks Media*
- **Goal:** Predict which customers are most likely to cancel their subscription to enable proactive retention strategies.
- **Data & Methods:** Cleaned and processed customer data, engineered engagement and tenure-based features, one-hot encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features. Applied statistical tests (chi-square, t-test) to explore churn drivers, trained a logistic regression model with class balancing, SMOTE oversampling, and hyperparameter tuning to improve recall, and evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

### 4) Project 4 - *Business Intelligence Dashboard for TechHub Retail*
- **Goal:** Develop an interactive dashboard to provide executives with real-time visibility into sales, profit, and customer performance.
- **Data & Methods:** Merged and validated three datasets in Tableau, created calculated fields for profitability, lifetime value, and product age, and built an interactive multi-filter dashboard with drill-down hierarchies and visualisations for KPIs, revenue trends, product lifecycle performance, customer segmentation, and regional/seasonal patterns. Applied colour-coded design for clarity and interactivity, with insights supporting supplier prioritisation, seasonal campaign timing, and acquisition channel optimisation.
